        About Me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-dark-muted leading-relaxed">
        I'm a dedicated Computer Science student at Ashesi University with a passion for technology and problem-solving. 
        With experience in web development, database management, and mathematics tutoring, I bring both technical skills 
        and strong communication abilities to every project. I'm actively seeking internship opportunities where I can 
        apply my skills in software development while continuing to learn and grow in the tech industry.
